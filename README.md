# Welcome everyone!
We are here to learn and share about technology, mostly programming. Why we said mostly? Because we also learn about containers, database, security etc.

We believe that programming is for everyone (of coure, who wants to learn new things)

## History
Jakarta Learns Programming (JLP) was initiated on January 2015. It was intended to learn general topics about programming.
Since then, (almost) monthly events was held to share more about programming, aiming newbie audience. In 2016, we collaborated with Tech In Asia Conference in Jakarta.
